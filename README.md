#ConflictResolver Dice Game
Welcome to the ConflictResolver Dice Game—a project born during my initial foray into learning JavaScript. Designed with the primary objective of settling friendly disputes among my friends, this game adds an element of chance to decision-making.

#How it Works
Players roll the virtual dice.
The winner of the dice game gains the power to decide on the next course of action—whether it's choosing a dining location or resolving any other friendly conflicts.
Why I Created This Game
As a novice in the realm of JavaScript, this project not only served as a practical application of my learning but also brought a fun and interactive dimension to decision-making within my social circle.
